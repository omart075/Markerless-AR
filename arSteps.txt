1. Find paper and apply perspective transform
	- this will be the query image to find in the scene

2. Feature Descriptors:
	- take in query image (perspective transform) and scene image
	- find key points and descriptors
	- use knn to find k best matches
	- apply ratio test to filter out matches
	- find homography:
		- returns M which is a 3x3 matrix that can transform a point in one image plane to the same point in another image plane
		- H = K[R|t] (camera extrinsics)
		- apply warp perspective on query using M matrix
		- reapply homography
		-
